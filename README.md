# MechanicalMatch--AI
Repo that includes the phases of an assignment sequence for CS5400: Intro to AI. First phase was file parsing, legal action generation, state generation, and a simple breadth-first tree search algorithm. Second phase was iterative-deepening depth-first tree search. Third phase was greedy best-first graph search employing a heuristic. Fourth phase was A* graph search, which employed a custom high-quality heuristic.

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
In each folder for the applied search algorithm, there is a run.sh file. Executing the file in a UNIX environment is easy by navigating to the directory and typing './run.sh'. The solution and time is outputted in a solution.txt file.
